# marian
Project for Programming Basics class, first semester on Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology
The goal - make a Mario clone using sdl library. It's far from perfect clone - only 3 levels (not even in order), no powerups, one enemy type, no sound, ... But still I think it turned out pretty well!
